Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e-mail
It 's a long but very worthwhile read
" A View from the Eye of the Storm
However , I will touch upon it only in passing
Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood
* 1 . The first element is the suicide murder .
It is a very potent psychological weapon
Its real direct impact is relatively minor
September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many
So what is all the fuss about suicide killings
It is always shown on television in great detail
This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World
We may arrange for the best airport security in the world
What is behind the suicide murders
It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs
No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up
No relative of anyone influential has done it
Are n't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven
Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair
The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa
Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation
You must go after the head of the " Family "
The United States understands this now , after September 11
Russia is beginning to understand it
In my humble opinion , this will definitely happen
The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning
The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable
Until Europe wakes up , this unity will not be achieved
* 2 . The second ingredient is words , more precisely lies .
Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic
You will not believe your own eyes
But words also work in other ways , more subtle
Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows
These words are much more dangerous than many people realize
They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities
He is now being outperformed by his successors
* 3 . The third aspect is money .
In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves
The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate
Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations
Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him
Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers
Should there be death penalty , for deliberate multiple murders
These are the old - fashioned dilemmas
But now we have an entire new set
Do you raid a mosque , which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage
Do you return fire , if you are attacked from a hospital
Do you raid terrorist headquarters , hidden in a mental hospital
All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas
Well , you do not want to face the dilemma
But it can not be avoided
But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done
The picture I described here is not pretty
What can we do about it
In the short run , only fight and win
The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force
The outer circle can not be eliminated by force
If you want to be sure , it is best to do both
Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list
Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel
It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture
It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons
When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully
Above all , never surrender to terror
But it really does not matter
In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more
Is the solution a democratic Arab world
It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully
I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail
Europe , more than any other region , is the key

Visualisations can be as useful tools , but meditation is more than that
Meditation has to do with what is called ideation
Find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed
Your breathing should be calm and relaxed , through the nose
Continue to breathe slowly and deeply
Imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally
Feel yourself floating above the earth and sea
The golden rays feel soft and soothing
Now you are far above the earth - into space
Everything around you is so vast
Yet , there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness
Try this for 5 to 10 minutes
Now come back to earth again - slowly
Imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully
Your muscles are loose and limp
Feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again
The sun 's rays and warmth are still with you , surrounding you
You are in a state of peace and relaxation
Let your mind and body be totally at peace
Now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction
Feel you 're completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness

Attack on Iran : A Looming

An examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order

Iraq , already a seething cauldron , will sink further into chaos

In essence , Iran holds the high ground in the Gulf

which one out of these makes the best pet
and why is the one a better pet
I have a hamster , and mice and rats like to escape
So my opinion is Guinea pigs
( plus they do nt stink that bad
Depends on what you want in a pet , to be honest
I 've had experience with all of those pets except Degus
My favorite would have to be the rat
They 're incredibly social , highly trainable , and very clean
That means expense , space , and they require weekly cage cleaning
Again , pairs or trios and pretty big living space
I 've never met a hamster that did n't bite me
Never had / handled a Degu
They are social and like to be handled
You have to have two because they do n't do well alone
Make certain you get two females
Two males can fight and you definitely do n't want babies
Also they ca n't eat potatos , they are toxic for them
Fostering 6 week old kittens and HATING IT
My legs and hands are just full of scratches
That 's kind of the way it goes .. lol
Limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring
If you have limited options , try the bathroom
Make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often
Also if they have diarrhea , check in with your foster coordinator
They made need medication or deworming or something
They are testing out their claws and teeth
I find the adults are much easier
Decide volunteering is not your thing and give them back
And do more research before you agree next time
Take the kittens back to the shelter

please specify which royal or carnival ship
Carnival and Royal Caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings
Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other
Are there any major differences between them
Explore which cruise may fit your needs the best
Shows Each night there are a variety of shows
On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act
They both had pools for kids and adults
We liked the Liberty 's pools better because one had a slide
Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it
We did not try the spa on the Mariner of the Seas
Usually you ca n't go wrong when getting a spa treatment
Royal Caribbean is better , but the best cruiseline is Regent Seven Seas
Carnival has been called the WalMart of cruise lines

How do you make your cat adjust to a new house
How could we make it settle in a new house
you are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory
close the door , and keep him in there for a week

good luck with your new house and with his new territory
In time though she / he will adjust .
they just do it on their own
Last night , I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd
My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate
He wo nt even get close to the crate
If I come towards him , he will run away
How do I train him to feel comfortable in his crate
and to willingly go outside ... and to come on command
He wo nt do anything on command
Yes , lots of time and lots of patients
I just do nt know how to do it with a grown dog
She tosses me around like it s nothing
Is there any tricks I could use
Maybe get a book on training
You have to be in command at all times
I would start with a leash
Then take the leash off and do nothing else but that
Let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason
Let him walk in and out for a few days
Open the door and let him out and see how he acts
If you push it , it will never work
He will learn to really like this
Potty outside will come at some point
Should I just settle and book on line
or is it better if I wait till I get there
Also , any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well
If you want reliable and inexpensive ... try Sinh Cafe / Tourist

Very few clubs and night activities
Oh , if you are confused
Sinh Cafe is not a Cafe
It is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc

i have a baby eastern king snake
according to the vet , he is healthy and looks good
he has been going to the bathroom like he should
i handle him every few days
i just love him to death
i do n't know why he wo n't eat though
he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them
he does n't seem to know that they are food
he wo nt even try to bite
he has n't eaten in an entire month
i 've only tried to feed him one at a time
he 's just a tiny baby , about the width of a pencil
When you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him
If you feed him too many he could just not be hungry
Remember snakes can go a while without eating
They have a natural instinct to hibernate
Another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding
Its body will be dull looking , too
In a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin
They 're fit and healthy and their care is suitable
That 's why it 's good to have a python
It 's twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month
are my two cats fighting or playing
you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough
then let her out for ten minutes
make it fifteen the next day , then twenty , and so on
she will be able to sleep without being afraid
the territory thing will be solved
when they play fight , they do n't hiss
if they hiss , they are not playing
hissing is OK , unless they start to fight
if that happens , separate them , and give them time apart
A hiss is basically a " get the f*ck away " sound
It means they 've gone too far
When they start bleeding that means they 're really fighting
I can see how you get confused though .
What was the goal for North Vietnam in the Tet offensive
He did not give them the number of troops they requested
They could not defeat the Americans
The ARVN rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked
When give the ultimate choice , they rallied
Tet was a huge military and political disaster for the Communists
They screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it
To emancipate the south , but it was a serious failure
To make the war unpalatable to the American public
In that , they pretty much succeeded
Try google to find the title if you would like to read it
I just bought a baby one yesterday
I also was wondering how long should this light be on
I have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze - dried crickets
Any advice would be greatly appreciated
UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source
You need to also provide a source a UVB lighting
Live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried
As for the heat , just be sure to use a thermometer
Also try green leafy veggies , like kale and spinach
Is a finch or a parakeet better
oh and please say y one is better thx
I did the same thing that you did for christmas
I ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas
At first it was all cool and all
They were chirping and doing their every day business
After a couple of weeks I got tired of them
They are quite messy and you can not hold or pet them
I ve tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed
They do nt want to be held or touched
I want a bird that I can hold and do tricks
I still have them and they are doing well
A couple of months after I got parakeets / budgies
They are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality
First of all they are very tame
I tamed them in 4 days
They can do tricks and they are nt messy
My parents even plays with them
They are a big part of our family
I hope this helps you with your decision
They are both about the same noise level
When choosing a parakeet look for a young one
the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older
( think of a balding man lol ) Look for clean feathers
The girl has either pink or brown
I would recommend that you get two parakeets
But get either one male and one female , or two males
I have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy
These are the steps I used
Honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets
Hopefully they will work for you
2 ) Then place you hand in the cage
I took the cage and place it next to the couch
Do this for about one hour
Push you finger to their feet gently and say up
Do not hit , yell , or harm them
and when I say go home it means to go in the cage
They worked for me and I hope they worked for you
They are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them
I have a parakeet named Cookie .
When is the best time to travel to Ireland
My sister and I would like to go to Ireland
And then there ’s the rain
County Kerry is the worst affected
The southeast is the driest , enjoying a more continental climate
Some basic assumptions , however , can be made
Spring festivities include the ever - popular St Patrick ’s Festival
Waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella
If you mean the Republic of Ireland ( Dublin ) then anytime
We used our BBQ on precisely 4 occasions
You do realise it is quite expensive to visit Ireland
Eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to America I believe
I have 4 Golden Wonder Killifish
1 of them is really colorful and is about 6 cm long
The last one is colourful too but it is about 4 cm long
I feed them Flakes , and Live Earthworms uncut everyday
If they are able to take earthworms uncut , that is really impressive
If you have plants in your tank
If you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop
Separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff , they may produce more
They also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins
The water changes help with that too
You also may need to treat the incubation water
The chlorine and ammonia ( choramine ) are not good for the eggs
If a pair is n't leaving eggs ... check the following
2 . Have we kept up with partial water changes
3 . Is there too much mineral in the water
Aplo. lineatus are wide - spread over southern India
That indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries
A number of minerals are not of much consequence
In time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container
Other will add a drop of Methylene blue
Hope there is useful grist for the mill here
Disney cruise line with young ones
I will be taking my 3 and 4 yr olds
What is the best time of year
Any tips or advice to make this a great experience
Many families are set to plan a best holidaying
They look for fun filled , rejuvenating and memorable vacation
Disney cruises , is a simple answer to this
The ship is designed thematically , with imposing animated cartoon characters
Kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities

Both are made keeping in mind the comforts of the travelers

It is really an entertainment for the kids
To relax and to rejuvenate Disney cruise are the best option
There are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates
You may also want to avoid Thanksgiving week and the Christmas holidays
Check out the kids ' space as soon as you get onboard
Do NOT feel guilty about taking them there
Bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door
We had an inside cabin and it is what I would recommend
The range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities
If you should miss a meal , you also missed a great show
but food is always available and it is consistently good
I think I gained three pounds in my week long cruise
This is about my farrier , girls
That 's why I 'm posting here
Well , I 'll try to make this short
He told me to remember to call like 3 times before he left
I do n't know if I should call him again tomorrow or not
It 's a father and son business
Anyway , I would appreciate ANY insight on this at all
Thank you for reading if you did !
So , obviously I switched back to these guys
I 've known the guy for about 10 years
He is a few years older than me
And yes , I do like him
And as far as scheduled visits go , I have no idea
I 've never done that before though either
And they usually come out within a few days
He will call you back I m sure
Sounds like He really likes you
But you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way
would You like going for * coffee * with him
or is he Not your type
If i were you I would Go
sort a wonder what it would have been like
He had this Habit of telling you Everything
EPM , Anyone Dealt with it
He 's not lame , but he 's been having issues
Here 's what the owner has said
Had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems
He is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle
I CAN NOT afford to treat whatever is wrong with him
So I might get the horse and see what I can do
My other theory would be wobblers
Horse is out of state and not local
Owner is willing to meet me half way with him
I will be calling my vet and chiro about him
He 's still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle
I am willing to pull the EPM test and treat
The owner is the one who is unable
The horse is not in pain
The horse is not in pain
He 's not putting it back on
I know this is going to be expensive
I 'm willing to give it a shot
Looked at studies , treatment options and such
I will have the EPM test done before treating
If that is the case then acupuncture is n't going to hurt him
It 's actually one of the alternative therapies for
Is that something you are up for
Pretty much every large stable has here
We hauled the horse to Windsor and got him treated there
That horse returned to racing and we did n't notice much difference
One horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for EPM
Let us know what you decide to do
Personally I think you should just keep on walking by
Could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy
Or has it occurred since birth
I also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke
Who knows what the future might hold , and it might be expensive
Rude , insensitive , discourteous people
He knows what he s doing

I took my 2001 Nissan Frontier in to fix a cracked manifold

I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else
Beautifully written reviews Doctor , but completely UNTRUE
I did not have a good experience w / Dr. Ghassemlou
I learned more about this doing my own research afterward
I have had my back fused in 2 places
I wish that I had n't done this
Unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon
I have been to Kim at Cheveux for more than five years
Quaint , lovely , small salon with BIG personality
My hair has never felt this healthy , either
I can not recommend this salon enough
( it 's by the door , on the hostess stand
Rude , unprofessional , just jerks
Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless
I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again
She deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly
She recommended products but absolutely did n't pressure me to buy
And students get $ 5 off , ca n't argue with that
Yeah , this complex is not very good
I think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers
If you do not smoke , do not move here
Chicken salad salad is great too
The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well
Might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light

It was a Saturday and my spring was broken
The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair
Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service
I would n't send my dogs there
I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010
I did n't even buy the bag there
The atmosphere was nice and very clean
The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters
We orderd our meals anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas
Everything was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor
Hopefully they spice things up or they wo nt be in business long
Half the tables and bar were empty by this point
Other Thoughts : Will try this place again
There must be a reason so many people like it there
the people at Fidelity Leasing were very friendly and helpful
from start to finish they were top notch
i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car
This insurance co. Is a joke
They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever
They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves
They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation
Ifa is an acronym for I m a F%#king Assh@%$e
Great service , great pricing and SUPER CONVENIENT
They have been extremely helpful whenever I have asked for help
I have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety
The well - equipped , clean gym is a plus
Great place to live if you work in and around downtown San Jose
I interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel
Very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service
Do n't waste your time or money
Yea , Dr. Mann ai n't so great
We took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead
They actually itemized it as a DISPOSAL fee

Lucky I had a spare with me
Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating
We arrived Sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked
We were told that we could n't today because they were closing soon

Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure
College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE
Went to the school here OVER PRICED
You do NOT learn the things you were promised
Over priced for students to learn
This store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising
With higher than average prices to boot
Go next door to the Ball Square Cafe instead
I guess you get what you pay for
I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart
Very nice work and friendly guys too
Best money I 've spent on remodeling ever
I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership
( You can hear the wind while driving on highway
Very likely it needs a new window seal )
( But this is a certified car from a dealer .
So I brought the car back the second day
Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing
So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER
STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
Everyone was so helpful that I can not wait to go back
We were also served salad and soda
I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews
I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment
Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did
I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style
This was a less than impressive experience at Trio 's
Run for the hills ... you 'll be much better off
To warn you to stay away from this place just is n't enough
We were having a major problem in maintaining cash
Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job
Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time

FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way

On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved
Ca n't wait to go back

Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary
Lovely Nails on Cayuga St. in Lewiston ,
There were four of us and I was taken first by a gentleman

He also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back
If the pedicure lasted 20 mins. , that was a stretch
Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility
I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs

They certainly know what they are doing
I stopped in today @ Yards Brewery
I had a sampler of IPA , Brawler , Love Stout & ESA
If you are in Philly you have to come check this place out
The only negative I have abou this place is the parking
I left with a case of BRAWLER !!!!
All of this started after their oil change
Took my Cruze in twice for poor fuel economy
The first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg
I wonder if they were going down a hill
They told me to bring it back after 5000 miles
I brought it back with 9000 miles
They " finished " the work and told me the car was ready
I will never purchace another vehicle from Vic Canever

There were 3 names before us
The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting
I could not understand any his reasons
We even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests

We waited until 2:25 PM and then left
This was our first visit to your studio
and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on Google
This place is marginal at best
Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained
They were thorough , high class , and went above and beyond
They just really know their stuff
NEVER fear going to the dentist again
I 'm 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life
By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist
My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me
It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment
At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around
I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did
I never felt pain or discomfort

Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad
I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here
I have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful
I had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail
Then I got a bill for $ 483.00
The doctor 's office said that payments had been " reversed "
Blue cross has no record of aa reversal
How much could it possibly cost
I think this office has some serious billing practice issues
They have the best rates and GREAT customer service
They did that with no problem
They recently surprised me a larger order
I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more
They have a customer for life in us
i made the mistake of buying from these thieves
I paid 2 k cash for a truck with a blown motor
Well I think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right
Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home
If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day
Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2 k bucks
I popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at Starbucks
It 's an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness
printing , printing , copies , printing , copies , printing
This company is overpriced for their services
Be warned - they 'll ltake you for everything they can
This is THE premier university in Virginia
The U of R is also recommended , too
To add insult to injury , he refused to refund our money
FHS is a good high school -- c / o
I enjoyed my time at Franklin High School
Many students went to Rutgers , including their top - ranked pharmacy program
Absolutely the best little motel on the coast

Stop in and have a bite you wo n't regret it

Food Craving Gone and Weight Loss at Acupuncture
It hurt very little , felt more like pressure than pain
What I like most about Dr. Liau is that she is very caring
She talks to you at each appointment
I can tell she really cares and wants to help
I am SO GLAD to have found Dr. Liau
Now I feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer
Bowtie has filled that role nicely
The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood
Best of all , there are no ads !!!!
Just previews and the main feature
But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie
A great cinema in a great location
My first visit was so fun yesterday
I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things
The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years
Great name for a great store
I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis
Was quoted $ 55 all inclusive of grinder inserts , etc

They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved
I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals
Okay , here 's the scoop
I 'm a regular at the HH
The food is excellent , the serivce is horrible
You just have to know what you 're getting into when you go
Like the girl with the fuse problem
The other rolls were n't at all special , especially given their pricing
But I 'd go elsewhere unless the prices are cut
It 's just not worth it
I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007
These are not household type alarms
When they sound off , it is a true audio / visual experience
I called the front desk and got no answer
Do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night
Poor Service , Lack of Passion : Do NOT
That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it
And another $ 100 for wrapping the furniture
So totalling $ 212 just for start before any work started
Guess what , was not in the initial agreement as well
One more thing , they do n't take any credit cards or checks
Do not live here , you will regret it
I figure I would give this company a chance
We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late
Just curtains and a couple of accessories
This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it
Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked
I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms
Sure enough he charged it to the credit card
I also mentioned to the reception person
He responded " we have problem with ' people ' "
Imagine a hotel having problems with people
I finally alerted him to his rudeness
He said he 's had a long and bad day
I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also
Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion
I emailed 4 times , never a response
I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing
I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza
I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC
Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around
I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL
They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano
It tasted like I just flew back home
That being said , I do n't know how their delivery service is
Good food , good wait staff , poor
The food was good , and so was our waitress
I then asked if I could have money back in cash
Her answer was short and manner rather rude
I will not be visiting Mama Mia 's again
ON A BAD NOTE THE WAITING AREA IS NOT ENJOYABLE OR ENOUGH SEATS
ALSO , THERE SHOULD NOT BE PEANUTS ALL OVER THE FLOOR
NEXT , THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON BRINGING YOU YOUR FOOD
I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS
I WAS THERE ON MARCH 6TH , 2009
BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY
their mezza luna's are deffly better than the pizza rolls
it seems like it s healthier too , but it s prolly not
anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it
it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger
I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael
The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes
Friendly , knowledgeable , and above all fair
Thanks for the great deal and the great car
Myself and my fiance 's identity was stolen from the office staff
Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us
It was a black female that use to work in the office
That s how they were caught
The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers
Short time later the guy would leave , then the girl leave
I lived in one that did not face the parking lot
Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper
If I found a spot , I could nt fit in it
Gates worked 30 % of the time at best
Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad
The best there is in service
I hope I can return the favor in the future
Service and Client base not ok
Cheese was falling off , so oily and greasy
THIS STORY IS 100 % TRUE
That little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my *ss
Long Lines , Silly Rules , Rude Staff , Ok
Well , this may be an exception
Save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together
SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES
This chef knows what he is doing
Treat yourself and go -- you will go back
Can not wait to go gain
I think that the re pretty good
Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week
In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice
If you want miracles you 'll have to go to 21st St
They do n't do certain things that are really annoying about other offices
I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience
Update : I had to add to my review
I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch
We were greeted again and sat promptly
The portions were generous enough that we even took some home
I have to say the value of this place always amazes me
The service was excellent and personable
That is just unheard of these days
He is my mechanic going forward
We made the decision for a couple of reasons
How has it gone so far
The intruders slit the screen of the window
Friendly staff , but definitely some
A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room

And what did we expect ... that he bench test every part
I asked if they could copy the piece I dropped off
I picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30.00
The girl at the desk was sooo rude I could not believe it
I explained I did not get what I paid for
They need to update the locker rooms ASAP
I will never recommend this gym to any woman
There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500
I feel obligated to share this story
Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation
I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick
$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total
I cried the entire way home
It was the salon experience from absolutely Hell
That 's my favorite show of all time
Maybe he did n't do a good job and they told him so
That said - he seemed to be doing well enough
Well , that was strike one
In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN
I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place
Because they cut me good deals if I paid in cash
( They even got me a couch pretty quickly .
My experience with Home Delivery Service has been one of disappointment and anger
If I could give them a lower rating than poor I would
No one will give me a date
How do you lose a drawer
So I am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite
Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear
Trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself
Do n't worry , I 'll take care of you !
Here I am now driving confidently on my own
Review on House of Joy Chinese
Well it took us a while to find one that we liked
But we do n't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT
They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted
We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls
And every entree we have ordered is perfect
Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh
Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive
The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with
They are also quick at getting your order out to you
You do n't have to sit and wait around forever like most places
and you will go back for more
We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago
So that comment is completely false
Because we think IT 'S THE BEST
and we do n't know them except for eating there

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
Lots of rules , phantom innkeeper , last minute price was worth it
They had a room with a $ 99 rate , which I booked
However upon our arrival no one there ( the inn was open )
They count the cans in the trash to make sure
# 4 ) Breakfast is 8 AM to 10 AM
If you go later , it 's all cleaned up
( By whom , I do n't know
All these rules are posted in the rooms .
Bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems
Do n't get the rooms off the two kitchens
They are RIGHT OFF the kitchen so you hear everything
It 's an entirely up and down experience , however
That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world
Dinner was also an up - and - down experience
I guess that tells you a lot
Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good
And my -- no , I still do n't remember what I had

So I got just my other rear tire replaced
